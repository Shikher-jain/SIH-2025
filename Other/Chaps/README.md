7. [System Implementation](07_implementation.md) - Technical aspects of deployment and usage
8. [Case Studies and Applications](08_case_studies.md) - Real-world examples and scenarios

## How to Use This Guide

This guide is designed for educators teaching agricultural technology, remote sensing, or AI applications in agriculture. Each chapter includes:

- Learning objectives
- Key concepts
- Practical examples
- Discussion questions
- Additional resources

The guide builds upon previous chapters, so it's recommended to follow the sequence. However, individual chapters can be used independently based on your curriculum needs.

## Prerequisites

Students should have basic knowledge of:
- Python programming
- Basic statistics and mathematics
- Agricultural concepts (optional but helpful)
- Remote sensing principles (optional but helpful)

## Technical Requirements

For hands-on exercises, students will need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or similar environment
- Required Python packages (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- Sample datasets (provided in the system)

This Teacher's Guide complements the technical documentation by providing an educational framework for understanding and teaching the AI-Powered Spectral Health Mapping System.
